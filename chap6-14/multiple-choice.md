# Multiple choice

1. The Eq class - makes equality tests possible (c)
2. The type class Ord - is a subclass of Eq (b)
3. Suppose the type class Ord has an operator >. What
   is the type of >? -
   Ord a => a -> a -> Bool (a)
4. In x = divMod 16 12 - the type of x is a tuple (c)
5. The type class Integral includes - Int and Integer numbers (a)
